Let\\'s have a look at all the components of the     metrics explorer.</li> </ol> <p>{width=\"6.060605861767279in\" height=\"3.3659667541557305in\"}</p> <p>Fig 26: Metrics Explorer</p> <p>On the left side we have the metrics query. This allows you to select one or multiple data sources to query. On the right side you then have the chart, as well as the information about the query response data. Finally, if you want to save your exploration, you can use the \\\"Save\\\" button on the top right. Let\\'s have a look at the query builder first. This is completely UI-driven and contains the following steps:</p> <p>a.  Metrics Selection</p> <p>b.  Filtering</p> <p>c.  Grouping</p> <p>d.  Top N</p> <p>e.  Aggregation</p> <p>We will go over each of them individually starting with the metrics selection. This allows you to graphically select the metric from all possible options.</p> <ol> <li> <p>You start by picking an\u00a0Instrument, which you can think of as     the source that reports the data to Intersight. For example,     the\u00a0Network Interface\u00a0instrument would contain data reported by     interfaces, or\u00a0Temperature\u00a0would contain data reported by     temperature sensors.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you then pick an instrument, you are presented with a list of     available metrics that are reported by these data sources. You can     always hover over the info icon next to the metrics to get more     information. Keep in mind that all metrics belonging to an     instrument will share certain attributes. You can find more     information about     that\u00a0here.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the final step, you will have to select a statistic, which     determines how data is aggregated.\u00a0Statistics\u00a0can best be     explained with an example: assume that you have 60 temperature     measurements per hour stored in Intersight. If you create a chart     that only shows one entry for every 10 minutes, you will have to     somehow create a single datapoint out of the 10 datapoints that are     available in Intersight. This is what statistics allow you to do.     Depending on what you want to find out, different statistics are     better.</p> </li> </ol> <p>{width=\"6.070707567804025in\" height=\"3.978648293963255in\"}</p> <p>Fig 27: Metrics Selection</p> <ol> <li>Once you have selected a metric, you can then add filters and     groupings to refine your query. Filters allow you to remove certain     parts of the data from the result. For example, you could filter out     certain device types - maybe you only want to get temperature     readings for blades.</li> </ol> <p>{width=\"6.060605861767279in\" height=\"5.184149168853893in\"}</p> <p>Fig 28: Metrics Filter</p> <ol> <li>Group by\u00a0statements allow you to split up the data based on the     groups you select. By default, the explorer will retrieve only a     single datapoint per time unit. If you have 100 servers, you would     still only be shown a single datapoint. To create multiple     datapoints, you can then have to add these groups. One example could     be grouping based on the hostname of the device, which would then     create one line for each physical device. If you add more than one     group, each unique combination will result in one line.</li> </ol> <p>{width=\"6.075171697287839in\" height=\"5.159222440944882in\"}</p> <p>Fig 29: Metrics Grouping</p> <ol> <li>When you add\u00a0Group by\u00a0statements in a large account, you can     easily end up with hundreds or even thousands of lines in the graph.     This is not a practical solution, which is why Intersight limits     graphs to at most 10 lines. If your query contains more data than     that, you can use the\u00a0Top N\u00a0configuration to limit the amount of     data to just the top results. You can select how many results you     want to have - at most 10 though.</li> </ol> <p>{width=\"6.042727471566054in\" height=\"6.303029308836395in\"}</p> <p>Fig 30: Metrics Top N</p> <ol> <li> <p>Finally, you can add an aggregation to your query. This will take     all the individual lines you have and combine them back into a     single line. This is a rarely needed setting, but it can still be     useful to have in certain scenarios.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can add more than one query at a time if you want to plot     different things in one graph. You can add a second query by     clicking on\u00a0Add Metrics, or by clicking the clone button on an     existing query.</p> </li> </ol> <p>{width=\"6.062678258967629in\" height=\"6.8181813210848645in\"}</p> <p>Fig 31: Adding/Cloning additional metrics</p> <ol> <li> <p>Now that the query is done, let\\'s have a look at the presentation.     You have three main options to modify the chart:</p> </li> <li> <p>Chart Type</p> </li> <li> <p>Time Interval</p> </li> <li> <p>Granularity</p> </li> <li> <p>Let\\'s go over them starting with the chart type. This setting     determines what type of chart will be used. Most times a traditional     line chart will be the best option, but it is always a good idea to     play around with the chart types. Depending on the scenario, a     different chart type might allow you to visualize your data better.</p> </li> </ol> <p>{width=\"6.070707567804025in\" height=\"3.6050667104111986in\"}</p> <p>Fig 32: Metric Chart Types</p> <ol> <li>The time interval determines what time interval is shown in the     chart. You can either select a relative time interval, like\u00a0Last     Week, or you can also use the\u00a0Custom\u00a0option, which enables you     to set your own absolute time interval with a date picker.</li> </ol> <p>{width=\"6.090908792650919in\" height=\"3.645174978127734in\"}</p> <p>Fig 33: Metrics Time Interval</p> <ol> <li>Finally, the granularity setting determines how many datapoints will     be graphed. You could, for example, graph the last 24 hours with a     granularity of\u00a01 hour, which will result in 24 datapoints. You     could also use 10 minutes, which will result in 144 (6 for every     hour multiplied by 24 hours) datapoints. There is no best answer as     to what granularity you should select. Higher is not always better,     as too many datapoints will clutter the chart and make it difficult     to see anything. Too few datapoints could result in missing details.     Play around with these settings to find the sweet spot for your use     case.</li> </ol> <p>{width=\"6.060605861767279in\" height=\"3.599067147856518in\"}</p> <p>Fig 34: Metrics Granularity</p> <ol> <li>There are a few more features you can use below the chart area.

Select     the Network Interface metrics.</p> </li> <li> <p>There are a lot of metrics available. In our case, we can simply     shorten the list by adding\u00a0bytes\u00a0in the search. We are then     looking for a metric called\u00a0Network RX Bytes. This tracks the     bytes that were received on an interface. The same metric also     exists for transmit as\u00a0Network TX Bytes. There is also a metric     that combines both:\u00a0Network Bytes. We want the individual values     though, as the combined metric could be deceiving. Finally, for     the\u00a0Statistic\u00a0we always want to make sure that we get     the\u00a0Maximum\u00a0utilization.

We only want to get the information for a single     blade; thus, we can filter down to that. One blade can have multiple     network interfaces, thus we can\\'t use the\u00a0Name\u00a0as a filter this     time, as the\u00a0Name\u00a0will represent the name of the network     interface.

We would like     to see individual interfaces though; thus, we will need to split up     our aggregated line into one line per interface. If we are not sure     what attribute we should choose, where would we go to find that     information? There is a comprehensive documentation for all metrics     that are supported in Intersight, grouped by the instrument. In this     case we are looking at network interfaces (instrument), thus the     relevant documentation can be     found\u00a0here.     Looking through the list of attributes, there is actually a very     simple answer. We are now looking at network interfaces     (instrument), thus the\u00a0Name\u00a0will now represent the name of the     network interface, and we can use that as a filter.</li> </ol> <p>{width=\"6.060605861767279in\" height=\"2.6463353018372704in\"}</p> <p>Fig 53: Group by Name</p> <ol> <li>So far, we have only looked at the RX side.

We are looking at metrics for network interfaces. As we will soon see, those metrics for network errors are also split up into RX and TX.

While this is useful when analysing details, we just want to have an overall idea of error counts on the server interfaces. There is one metric that shows the total error counts for each direction.</p> <ol> <li> <p>In Explorer add the following:</p> <p>a.
